 # arduino-posture-corrector
the slightly messy Arduino code needed for Thomas Li's science fair Arduino posture corrector.

Main project is main.ino

If you don't have a buzzer, use the nobuzzer.ino file instead of main.ino

Download the SharpIR libary for arduino included or it won't work

Optional: the python part. This will display real time 2d graphics that will show what the arduino thinks you're sitting like. COM3 MIGHT NOT BE YOUR USB PORT. REPLACE PORT BEFORE RUNNING SCRIPT.
